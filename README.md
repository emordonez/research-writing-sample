## About

This is a final research paper written for the course Program Evaluation in Developing Economies (ECON 451), taken at the University of Illinois Urbana&ndash;Champaign.

The course also covered randomized control trials, difference-in-difference estimations, and identification assumptions and strategies.

## Abstract

>The Philippines passed the Responsible Parenthood and Reproductive Health Act of 2012 and began its implementation in 2014.
>The delayed implementation was due to the Supreme Court immediately halting it in response to challenges until they upheld its constitutionality in 2014.
>One of the law's provisions is comprehensive sex education for all public school students in Grade 5 through high school.
>This paper details a quasi-experiment with high-school aged girls divided into two cohorts, one each that completed high school before and after the 2014 ruling, and measures their use of or intent to use modern methods of contraception.
>A secondary analysis of the 2017 Philippines Demographic and Health Survey finds no significant effect of high school sex education in determining contraceptive usage.
>The most significant positive predictors of use are marital and employment status, with urban residency exhibiting a significantly negative effect.
